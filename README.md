# Flickr-Stats

Get flickr stats for a user by entering their user id. Includes their total faves, total views, total comments and followers.

Enter the flickr ID and your Flicky API Key in the variables in main.py and run the code.

Use https://www.webfx.com/tools/idgettr/ if the flickr page has a name in the link instead of the users' flickr ID.
